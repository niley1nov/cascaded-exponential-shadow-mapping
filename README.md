# cascaded-exponential-shadow-mapping
Shadow mapping using modern OpenGL and C++. Three cascaded regions are implemented for higher resolution shadow near the camera. Exponential mapping giving better results then PCF and variance mapping. ImGUI is used to implement changeable parameters like sun direction, color, etc. Function to reduce light bleeding is implemented.

External libraries have to be included. They are - assimp,glfw,glew,glm.
